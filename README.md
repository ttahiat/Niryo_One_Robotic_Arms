# Niryo_One_Robotic_Arms


In modern factories, minimizing human intervention is crucial to ensure safety and efficiency. To achieve this, innovative methods for material handling are being developed, with a focus on automation.

This project aims to design a prototype for factory automation using robotic arms. Specifically, the Niryo One robotic arm is utilized within the CoppeliaSim software environment.

The Niryo One robotic arm is a versatile and user-friendly robotic platform designed for educational and prototyping purposes. It offers a range of functionalities, including precise motion control and integration with various sensors and peripherals.

CoppeliaSim, on the other hand, is a powerful robotics simulation software that allows users to create and simulate complex robotic systems in a virtual environment. It provides tools for modeling robots, sensors, and environments, enabling realistic simulations and testing of robotic applications.

In this project, the task involves transferring a rod from one side of the platform to the other, with a barrier in between. Multiple robotic arms, ideally four, are employed to perform the task simultaneously from different pick and drop points. It's crucial to ensure that the rod is not dropped at any point during the simulation, as it would disrupt the entire process.

Coordination between the robotic arms is essential to pass the rod seamlessly from one robot to another. This requires precise synchronization and communication between the robots to maintain a smooth workflow and achieve the desired outcome efficiently.
